Tasks Covered:

Show all staff members and their schedule information
(using LEFT JOIN so even staff with no schedule appear).

Show all services from services_weekly and their corresponding staff
(using LEFT JOIN to show services even with no staff assigned).

Display all patients and their service’s weekly statistics
(using RIGHT JOIN — all weekly records appear even if no matching patient exists).

Daily Challenge:
Create a Staff Utilisation Report, showing:
staff_id
staff_name
role
service
count of weeks present (include staff with zero presence)
Sort the results by weeks_present DESC.
